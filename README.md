# exposure-control-in-video-cameras-using-fuzzy-logic
The primary objective is to investigate the effectiveness of fuzzy logic in optimizing exposure parameters such as aperture, shutter speed, and ISO sensitivity. Fuzzy logic provides a flexible and adaptive approach to exposure control by incorporating human-like reasoning based on imprecise and uncertain information
